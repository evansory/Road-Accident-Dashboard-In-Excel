## Project Overview

This report presents a comprehensive Road Accident Dashboard, developed exclusively in Microsoft Excel for the years 2021 and 2022. The goal was to convert raw accident and casualty data into a dynamic and interactive dashboard that enables stakeholders to uncover key patterns, identify high-risk areas, and support strategic road safety decisions.

This project demonstrates advanced Excel proficiency, including data transformation, in-depth analysis, and intuitive visualization—delivered without the aid of specialized programming languages or Business Intelligence tools.
